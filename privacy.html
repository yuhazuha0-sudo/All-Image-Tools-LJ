    <h1>Privacy Policy — All Image Tools</h1>

    <p><strong>Updated:</strong> November 19, 2025</p>

    <p><strong>All Image Tools</strong> is a simple, privacy-first web tool that performs image compression <em>entirely in your browser</em>. This page explains what data (if any) we collect and how we handle it.</p>

    <h3>1. Local / Client-side Processing</h3>
    <p>All image processing (compression, resizing, format conversion) happens on your device in the browser. We do <strong>not</strong> upload images to our servers. Your images remain on your device unless you explicitly choose to share or upload them yourself.</p>

    <h3>2. Data We Do Not Collect</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>No images or files uploaded to our servers by the site.</li>
      <li>No personal files, photos, or documents are stored by us.</li>
      <li>No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected by default.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Analytics & Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>We may add third-party services (for example, Google Analytics) to understand usage patterns. If enabled, these services may collect anonymous usage data (page views, events like “compress” or “download”), but they will <strong>not</strong> receive or track your image files. You can request these analytics be disabled by contacting the site owner.</p>

    <h3>4. Cookies</h3>
    <p>The site does not require cookies for core compression functionality. If we add analytics or other optional features in future, cookies may be used according to those services' policies.</p>

    <h3>5. Security</h3>
    <p>Because all processing is client-side, the main security considerations are your device and browser. Avoid using untrusted public devices for processing sensitive images. We recommend keeping your browser up-to-date.</p>

    <h3>6. Links to Other Sites</h3>
    <p>This site may contain links (Donate, Help, About). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of external websites. Please review third-party site policies before sharing information.</p>

    <h3>7. Contact</h3>
    <p>If you have questions, concerns, or wish to request removal of any data (if ever stored), contact the site owner at: <strong>yuhazuha0@gmail.com</strong>.</p>

    <h3>8. Changes to this Policy</h3>
    <p>We may update this policy occasionally. When changes are made, the updated date will appear at the top of this page.</p>
